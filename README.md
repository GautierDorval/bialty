# BIALTY

BIALTY (Bulk Image Alt Text with Yoast) is a WordPress plugin that automatically adds ALT text to images based on page/post/product titles (including WooCommerce products) or Yoast SEO Focus Keywords, either separately or combined.

It also provides a post meta box that allows manual customization of ALT text on a per-page basis.


## Purpose

Image ALT text is critical for accessibility and for search engine understanding.
At scale, manually writing ALT text across many pages and products is time-consuming and inconsistent.

BIALTY exists to standardize and automate ALT text generation while keeping a clear override path when custom descriptions are required.


## Core behavior (high level)

– Generates ALT text from page/post/product titles, or from Yoast Focus Keywords.
– Supports WooCommerce product contexts.
– Allows manual per-page overrides via a post meta box.
– Focuses specifically on ALT attributes (not a general SEO suite).


## What this plugin is not

– Not a generic SEO plugin.
– Not an AI image captioning system.
– Not a replacement for editorial accessibility review.
– Not a guarantee of “perfect” ALT text in all contexts.
